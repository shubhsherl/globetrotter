The Globetrotter Challenge – The Ultimate Travel Guessing Game!
You’ll be building Globetrotter, a full-stack web app where users get cryptic clues about a famous place and must guess which destination it refers to. Once they guess, they’ll unlock fun facts, trivia, and surprises about the destination!

🔹 Core Requirements
1️⃣ Dataset & AI integration
You'll be provided with a starter dataset (sample.json).
Use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, OpenAI API, Web Scraping, etc.) to expand this dataset to 100+ destinations (in data.json).
The dataset should include clues, fun facts, and trivia for each destination.
2️⃣ Functional web app with the following features
✅ Present 1–2 random clues from the chosen destination.
✅ Let the user select from multiple possible destination answers.
✅ Provide immediate funky feedback after answering:

🎉 Correct Answer: Animate confetti + reveal a fun fact.
😢 Incorrect Answer: Show a sad-face animation + reveal a fun fact.
✅ Include a ‘Play Again’ or ‘Next’ button to load a different random destination.
✅ Display total user score, tracking correct and incorrect answers.
Note: Your dataset must be stored on, and retrieved from the backend! We don’t want users peeping through source code on the browser or having access to all questions and answers 🙈

3️⃣ “Challenge a Friend” feature
✅ User enters a unique username before inviting friends to play.This registers the user with the system and creates their profile.
✅ Clicking ‘Challenge a Friend’ button should:

Open a share popup with a dynamic image & invite link for WhatsApp.
The image could be generated using on-screen UI elements, or any 3rd-party service.
✅ The invited friend can see the invitee’s score before playing.
✅ Anyone with the invitation link can play the game with all features.
📌 What we’re looking for
🔹 Extensibility: Can your solution scale beyond these requirements?
🔹 Creativity in UI/UX: Make the game engaging & fun!
Note: If you are applying for a Backend role, this is NOT a must-have.
🔹 Effective AI Utilization: Use AI to complement your skills (dataset generation, code suggestions, etc.).

🔹Brownie points: Surprise us with unit test cases, well-written documentation, or anything else that truly reflects the geek within you.

🔹Ownership: Got a question about this assignment? Show ownership by answering it for yourself. There are no right or wrong answers here.
